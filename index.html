        <p>I am currently a Junior Developer studying Software Engineering FastTrack at Manchester Codes. I love to challenge myself and learn new skills. I studied Architecture at the University of Bath and Technische Universit√§t Dresden. After that I spent 15 years designing buildings mainly in the north of England.</p>

        <article><h3>Coding</h3></article>
        <p>After getting involved with small amounts of coding, I wanted to unlock more knowledge and start to develop my own solutions. View my journey on <a href="https://github.com/nic-bes">Git-Hub.</a></p>
        <article><h3>Architecture</h3></article>
        <p>Spaces that have community wide benefit are a key interest of mine. I have designed a lot of educational buildings, from new build schools, to extensions, to refurbishments and fit outs. I love to create spaces that inspire learning. </p>
        <article><h3>Illustration</h3></article>
        <p>One of my favourite activities is drawing illustrations, sometimes for myself, often for family and friends.</p>

        <article><h3>Snowboarding</h3></article>
        <p>Life doesn't get much more perfect than fresh snow and bright blue skies. Off-piste, on-piste, park, gulleys, powderfields, tree runs, it's all good.</p>
        <article><h3>mtb &amp f-Riders Mountain Biking Team</h3></article>
        <p>Dirt is the new snow, well it is in summer anyway. The only problem is it hurts a lot more when you fall. Having missed the chance to compete myself due to injuries and age, I set-up a team in 2013 to provide a talent platform for up-and-coming female riders racing nationally and internationally called F-Riders.</p>
        <article><h3>campervan conversion</h3></article>
        <p>Converting a mk7 ford transit mwb into a campervan for mtb, paddleboarding, hiking, wild swimming, while still enabling it to function as a basic van to haul things around in. Who knew it would take a global pandemic for me to make some real progress with it.</p>
